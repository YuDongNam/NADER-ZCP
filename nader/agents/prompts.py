Each block starts with "##block_name##", and each line has a description. You can use the "index:operation" method to represent the operation, and use the "index1->index2" to describe the calculation graph. Noting that the output node can have only one input.
The following is a list of available operations:
    Conv2d(out_channels,kernel_size,stride,dilation,groups) Two-dimensional convolution operation, 'out_channels' represents the output dimension; 'kernel_size' represents the convolution kernel size; 'stride' represents the step size, default: 1; 'dilation' is the hole convolution size, default: 1; 'groups' groups number of the channels, default:1.
    Linear(out_channels) Linear fully connected layer, 'out_channels' represents the output dimension.
    AvgPool2d(kernel_size,stride) Two-dimensional average pooling operation, 'kernel_size' represents the kernel size, 'stride' represents the step size.
    MaxPool2d(kernel_size,stride) Two-dimensional maximum pooling operation, 'kernel_size' represents the kernel size, 'stride' represents the step size.
    AdaptiveMaxPool2d(output_size) Two-dimensional maximum pooling operation pools the input feature map into a feature map with a length and width of output_size. For example, AdaptiveMaxPool2d(output_size=1) pools a feature map of the shape of (B,C,H,W) into (B,C,1,1) shape.
    AdaptiveAvgPool2d(output_size) Two-dimensional average pooling operation.
    Add Tensor-by-element addition operation, the input tensor shape for this operation must conform to the pytorch broadcasting rule.
    Mul Tensor-by-element multiplication operation, the input tensor shape for this operation must conform to the pytorch broadcasting rule.
    multiply Matrix multiplication operation, the two tensor shapes entered for this operation must conform to the pytorch tensor multiplication rule.
    concat(dim) Tensor concating operation, all tensors input to this operation are concated in the dim dimension. The sizes of the concated tensors dimensions other than the dim dimension should be consistent. For example, concat(dim=1) concates all input tensors in the 1 dimension.
    mean(dim) Average the tensor in dim dimension. For example, mean(dim=1) pools a input tensor of shape (B,L,D) into the output tensor of shape (B,1,D) by average in the dimension 1.
    max(dim) Maximize the tensor in dim dimension. For example, max(dim=2) pools a input tensor of shape (B,L,D) into the output tensor of shape (B,L,2) by max in the dimension 2.
    sum(dim) Sum the tensor in dim dimension. For example, sum(dim=0) pools a input tensor of shape (B,L,D) into the output tensor of shape (0,L,D) by sum in the dimension 0.
    softmax(dim) Apply a softmax operation at dim dimension. For example, softmax(dim=1) calculate the softmax of input tensor with shape (B,L,D) and the output tensor's shape is (B,L,D).
The activation functions that can be used are: ReLU, GELU, Sigmoid.
The normalization methods that can be used are:
    BN: Batch normalization
    LN: Layer normalization.
The tensor can be transformed by using the following operations:
    permute(*dims) rearranges the tensor dimensions, 'dims' is the order of the new dimensions, for example: permute(0, 2, 3, 1) changes the tensor shape from (B,C,H,W) to (B,H,W,C).
    repeat(*sizes) repeats the tensor along the specified dimensions. 'sizes' is a list containing the number of repetitions along each dimension. For example: repeat(1,3,2,4) repeats the tensor 1 times in the first dimension, 3 times in the second dimension, 2 times in the third dimenstion, 4 times in the forth dimenstion.
    reshape(*shape) changes the shape of the tensor to the specified shape; 'shape' is an array representing the new shape; you can use -1 as the size of a dimension to automatically calculate the size of the dimension to ensure that the total number of elements remains unchanged; for example: reshape(B,H,W,C) means changing the shape of the tensor to (B,H,W,C).
Variables you may use include:
    input: input feature map, the shape is (B,C,H,W);
    output: output feature map, the shape is (B,dim,H,W);
    C: the number of channels of the input feature map;
    dim: the number of channels of the output feature map;
    H: the height of the input feature map;
    W: the width of the input feature map
You can use the basic +,-,x, / operations.
